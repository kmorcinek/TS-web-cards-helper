TS-web-cards-helper is a lightway web app, that helps to play boardgame Twilight Struggle.
===================
The Twilight struggle game itself is ranked first in world wide ranking http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/1?sort=rank

## Issues
- Sad but it displays correctly only on Chrome.

## Main reason for developing this app

- there is about 100 cards in game, if you remember which cards have already been played, you are in better position
- many cards target specific countries. So it will be nice to reverse it and to have a fast overview of all possibble cards targeting my country

## Where it can be used?
I usually play online using vassal engine.

Current version is hosted at 
http://angelo.hostingasp.pl/index.html and http://angelo.hostingasp.pl/map.html (its playable but under development)

## Technologies used
JavaScript, KnockoutJS, (TypeScript), C# (only for offline data parsing from other pages and converting to JSON). (probably will evolve towards Single Page Application).

## Contributors
http://twilightstrategy.com - for providing great website about the game. I am parsing knowlegde already entered there.

I need some help. Not only developers, there is also some data that have to be manually entered based on the knowlegde of board game.

  All countries and cards are added. Connected cards are displayed on the map (not next to map like before), saves space.

  Hover over a country and you will see cards that are somehow connected to this country.
