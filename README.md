# Twilight Struggle web helper

The Twilight struggle game itself is ranked first in world wide ranking http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/1?sort=rank
This lightweight app is going to help you in playing the game.

## Play

Current version is hosted at http://kmorcinek.github.io/TS-web-cards-helper/src/KrzysztofMorcinek.TSCardsHelper.Web/ (or at 
http://twilightstruggle.krzysztofmorcinek.com/)


## Main reason for developing this app

- there are 110 cards in game, if you see which cards have already been played, you are in better position
- many cards target specific countries. So it will be nice to reverse it and to have a fast overview of all possibble cards targeting my country
- after coming back to the game after month you forgot a lot. It helps to find out again, what are the cards

## Where it can be used?

I usually play online using vassal engine.

## Technologies used

- JavaScript
- KnockoutJS
- TypeScript (you need [Web Essentails 2012](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6) to generate .js when saving .ts files)
- C# (only for offline data parsing from other pages and converting to JSON)
- (probably will evolve towards Single Page Application).

![Card border shows probability of card appearance](https://raw.github.com/kmorcinek/TS-web-cards-helper/master/screenshots/TS_card_border_shows_the_probability_of_card.JPG)
  
  Example of Iran. Cards with:
  - red border are "Sure to be in somebody's hand now"
  - no border are in the deck
  - blue border are "Will come soon, but not in the deck yet" - if you are in early war this means cards after reshaftle and Mid War cards, in Mid Game this means cards after second reshaffle and Late War.

  Cards that are connected directly to a country (UK in this example) are shown first before cards connected with Region (Europe).

![All countries and cards](https://raw.github.com/kmorcinek/TS-web-cards-helper/master/screenshots/All_countries_and_cards_Cards_on_the_map.JPG)
  All countries and cards are added. Connected cards are displayed on the map (not next to map like before), saves space.
